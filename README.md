# Instructions

To use the repository, use `git clone https://github.com/trannolis/jfk_atms.git` in the terminal to recieve the contents of the file.

Once the contents of the repository are stored onto your computer, you first need to install the relevant libraries, which is done through `pipenv install --dev`.

Afterwards, it is required to install mongodb from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ for testing.

Afterwards, it is suggested to run the command `make local`. This should open up a local version of the website on `localhost:5000`.

# Make Targets

### prod

Manages commits for the projects to ensure effective deployment of relevant servers.

### tests

Runs tests pertaining to the code to ensure that it compiles and formats correctly.

### dev_env

Ensures that the terminal is situated with the correct files to have the appropriate development environment for the project.

### heroku

Deploys the server to Heroku.

### docs

Ensures that the terminal starts in the correct directory to run relevant functions of the ATC.

### local

Runs the flask application on localhost:5000.
